Yeah , that makes",". Yeah , that makes","sense . Yeah , I","changed . Because now I","that they get when they're","be reduced . That makes","Yeah , that does make","the people to naturally be","to decline too . I","I mean , you never","the economic aspect it makes","I'd say that the only","What you are saying makes",". Yeah it does make","] , because I do","systemic . But I also","forced into slavery . I",". So I kind of","were African Americans , I","you said , I also","guess . And I also","And so that's why I",". But I also don't","don't believe that it's the","fact that - - I","the same time , I","fix it , but I","help . So I don't","Yeah . Well , I","- - well I don't","I don't feel , I","it's - - you can","learn it . So I","prone to listening to colonialized","to go . So I","see through that BS and","And try to be more","accepting nowadays ? I don't",". Yeah , honestly ,","thinking about it , I","pay them , \" you","see - - I don't","I don't know . I","be too crazy to even","think about . I don't","how . Because if you","that around , I don't","willing to change or to",", or if you don't","part of it . I","that we've - - it's","lives that we don't even","even notice it , you","know ? But I don't","else to say . I","too - - because I","thing . Uh-huh . I","part of that . I","really can , but I","mean it's still crazy to","I put no . I","completely against it because I","least for me , I","my opinion . I don't","know . Yeah . I","of - - I also","it . But I also","But then , I don't","opinions , hopefully we can","of all , you should","a very liberal person ,","being opposed to this might","of speech . And I","option ourselves to take that","to take that information and","and analyze and make a","speech . What do you","environment for everyone and I","family and I am really","my second point is I","we have the freedom to","what to do with the","credit for the ability to","the ability to analyze that","that information and make a","we are because of that","the freedom for us to","of the - - I","yourself at harm . I","money , but I don't","that's - - I don't","we have the freedom to","- you and I both","We have the ability to","ability to choose and to","influences coming in and opposing","and opposing thoughts and hateful","when we as a people","and value . We should","Super . Yeah . I","talking about this . This","counselor really helped me to","change . People changing ,",", meaning me and you","speech or hateful in their","to be heard . You","happens . And so I","I guess ? I don't","I totally agree . I","makes a certain group probably","I'm not into making people","people feel uncomfortable for any",". I want everybody to","campus . We've all got","anybody , and I do","deal to - - I","something . But I just","things like that , I","ultimately how it makes everyone",". Yeah . But I",". Yeah , that makes","care that much . I","end of all , I","good points . And I",". And I appreciate your","to say . So you",". Okay , so the","for slavery . Because I",". And so , I","fill these things I don't","issue . It's not really","And so , I don't","happen . And so the","isn't - - or the","of slavery , but I","the way that they're being","there . But I don't","or structures - - I","said - - I don't","don't think that would be","whatever . Yeah , I","could help . But I","- - I have no","some land . But I","back \" . But I","tough . Yeah , I","just - - I don't","each other . I don't","just time . Because I","a very different way of","and a different way of","it , and so I","kind of not right .","be crazy . I don't","participate in it and I","the system is . I","think most people probably already","is . And so I","I feel like that also","also complicates things . I","I . Yeah . I","it . Now , I","of slaves and they really",". And so for that","something like that . I",", right ? I would","are . Yeah . I","ones , like the drugs","put slight yes . I","people . But I also","about it , and I","I feel it was pretty","are weird here . I","the only thing . I","it could be for any","actually that it doesn't necessarily","you just listed . My","goal is not necessarily to","to solve addiction and completely","the opioid epidemic because I","think that that's a really",", first of which I","harm reduction . And I","of drugs . But I","system , which I just","at all . And I","And I mean , I","to be them , I","be positive . I also","drugs would potentially have the","the effect of , you",", which is , I","these communities . And I","anytime soon , so to","safest way possible , I","I think is a good","doesn't surprise me that you",". Yeah , I totally","about broad legalization and I","of that that I would","that - - and it's","why I do have semi-mixed","about this issue because I","drugs are legal could be","- - I don't really","Yeah , that's what I'm","well and that's why I'm","injection rooms , which I","open to . I don't","know what - - I","other thing is that I","of the - - I","that happening , I don't","really is . So I","ultimately what I support I","users . And I don't","know , I do have",", I do have complicated","either one of the two","- - I'm trying to","think if I had any","It's interesting because also I","to it . So I","that this issue is very","against legalizing drugs but the","first of all , I","it's called drugs for a","access - Yeah . I","21 years old , I","addictive and also because we","can actually - - they","around . This is another","the profits . So my","goes to the government ,","of diseases , which I","them efficiently .

Yeah , I","line as well . I","are also - - I","are de-legalized . I don't","drug seller then I don't",". Yeah . And I","And I think my country","more serious type . It",". Well it fits every","exactly . And also I","a person . I do","I do think that makes","legalize drugs because I don't","don't think legalizing drugs would","epidemics of addiction . I","LSD or drugs where their","effect is minimal or their","enforcement actions are , I","of drugs it would make","oxycodone pills , I don't","don't think legalizing them would","anxiety . So I don't",". Okay . I definitely","you're coming from . I",". I think I should","my position . I don't","should be prosecuted . I","the poor . And I","distributing . And I definitely","trafficking drugs illegal , I","for use . So I","saying . Oh , I","meant for heroin , I","by the suppliers , I","providing those pills , I","in the market and I","Mm . Yeah , I","some European countries . They","least . So I definitely","talking about . It makes","Okay , so I don't","go first and let me","let me know what you","right . Mm-hmm . I","I take kind of a","I don't - - I","first and say your three","you repeat - - it","it became what ? I","very harmful . But I","think of it from a","can get clean . I","like Amsterdam . And I","decriminalization . Right . I","a way that people can","a drug addiction , I","best case scenario . I",", could you repeat the","question ? Well , I","scenario . And then I",". Well , I don't","I don't know . I","legalization completely . That just","and - - I don't",". Yeah . And I","really good , but I","them there . Or I",". Yeah , I don't","- Oh , I don't","know . I was just","thinking , I don't necessarily","and demand . But I","like - - I don't","I don't know . I","No , no . I","drugs more , and I","true . Yeah . I","or - - I don't","I don't know . I","thing , but I don't","I don't know . I","case of Portugal more to","that I'm very , very","informed about . But I",". But also I don't","firm stance on legalization without","on legalization without knowing more","Right . Right . I","though , because I don't","use declined . So I","look at the statistics to","it , but I don't","all honesty , I don't","the survey . But I","But I mean , I",", I know what I","believe , so I'll just","assume that that's how I",". Basically , I don't","don't think it's a great","I do completely agree and","Have access . I don't","can I just ask one","? So by the standard","all drugs , I'm just","I'm just curious what your","thoughts - - do you","- yeah . So I","So I understand what you","to an addict , I",". Yeah , so let's","as a drug that I","at the store , who","you have someone who theoretically","you through it which I","And that's one of the","of the reasons I don't","or really anything in that","should be legalized . I","agree that the whole things","legal , sure it might","cool . But I don't","I completely agree . I","I guess it's just a","majority of drugs , I","So I , by no",", by no means ,",", I would just be","- - this is tangentially","on . If you don't","legalizing drugs is a good","idea , what are your","was going to say I","to - - it's so","our everyday life . I","Yeah , I guess I","are already illegal and I","people are - - I","get caught . And I","yeah . Yeah , I","or another . I don't","But regardless , I don't","And so one of the","of the reasons where I","key drugs , which I","Okay so I'm",", so why do you",". Okay . So I","should be legalized and I","I think that's because I","it would be , I","And then I would also","in jail . Because I","that's why . I don't","say . Yeah . I","of my - - I","legal there , but I","drown basically . And I",". And also , I","expensive too . But I","Yeah . Yeah , I","thing . Yeah , I","applicants . \" Do you","to go to the little","after this , or an","nervous and I have no","Business School ] , I","heard . Yeah , I","like the people because I","Haas being snake-y .

I","When I got here I",". \" That's what I","committees are cool . I","smaller and so its I","so you probably get to","Yeah . I","life . So I don't","I don't know .

That's true . I","here . Yeah , I","senior so I have to","- it's hard because I",", the fact that I","like data science . I","something - - I don't","old .

You don't have to","legalizing drugs , because I","drugs can cause worse health","I agree . I also","legalized . Yeah . I",". Because no one really","is . Yeah , I","with it .

I","programs and stuff , you",". I a hundred percent","Yeah .

Yeah , I","when I read the [","But then I kind of","get like actual , legitimate",", what ? I don't","don't know . I just","your point . I do","That's true .

I","I feel like ultimately the","why I'm mainly against the","government reparations . But I","isn't going to be really","resolved . That's what I","Okay . Actually , I","Okay , I don't really",". Okay , so I'm","Do you have any specific","poverty line . But I","starting over . But I","so in that case I","And so that's why I","different sources of the same","- I just want to","or whatever .

Yeah . I","topics . Yeah . I",". Yeah , because I",". Yeah , I don't","I don't know . I",". So what do you",", absolutely . I totally","totally understand that , I","a little more . I","thing is that I would","it , obviously . I","I think that it can","because then people grow up","you were saying , it",". So if you do","it's okay , and you","can do it , I",". And then I don't","decriminalized . I just don't","probably similar - - I'm","what you more or less",". Yeah , that makes",". Yeah , and I","legalized marijuana . So I","to come in . I","what happens because we don't","certain way . So I","before we can form a","form a conclusion . I","to come through and to","it is . I don't","cigarettes , but I do","do think that there's a","prior . So I'm just","what are the real health","for sure .

No , that makes","the researchers ] worded the",", I agree with the","it should be avoided I","controversial speakers . And I","I think if they can",", but what I was","actually - - I don't",". And I just immediately","That's true . Get their",", that's what I was","But , yeah . I","time is left . I","Yeah . Yes . I","government , and I don't","help them - - I","you might have a better",". Yeah , so I","I think I just don't","yeah , I was just","I was just wondering your","the U.S . What's your","I get this kind of","kind of question , I","individual responsibility . And I","our nation . And I",", is this really the","Americans or are there other","poor ? Maybe that's the","reason why - - I","I mean I just don't","actually help these people to","people to become better or","I didn't indicate that I","strongly about that . I","now . Yeah . I","where I stand . I","drug charge , I don't","adequate . Especially when you","basically - - I don't","I don't know how I",". Yeah , I hadn't","it too that I hadn't","run into ? Because I","Definitely right when I was","the first thing that I",". And nobody wants to","I also would want to",". So I kind of","right away . I don't","I don't know how to","lot of - - I","I mean people that I","here , \" but I",". And so I definitely","comes from the Earth doesn't","kind of measure this and","and they're thriving , you","? Okay , well I","- Okay , so I","agree with that . I","institutionalized racism . But I","situation . Yes . I","you're coming from . I","something very specific , I","to racism , and I","yeah , when you actually","I completely agree . I","type of reparations because I","the surface to make it","Yeah . But then I","situation , is that I","by that . So I","has to be a well","of education classes . I","that I also champion the","idea of diversity in political","thought . Because I also","think that being exposed to","shared . But I do","me . So I don't","times besides now , I","because controversial speakers doesn't always","Donald Trump . It can","are the issue , I","follows them . So I","to it , but I","or not they really do","they really do believe or","about can be a very","about it . So I","campus , and immediately they","definitely not Charlottesville . I","it's a mindset . I","were very scared about the","it safer for those who","resources put towards education and",". Yeah . I do","do think it is a","help them with because they",", essentially . And I","call 911 if you don't",". Well it's brought more","go ahead and start your","okay . So the main",", I guess it's a","culture . So from my","a non-drug user , I","I believe that legalizing drugs","marijuana - - so I","bothers me because I don't","So that's probably a better","that . But I don't","I don't think that's a",". So I guess you","borderline on this . The","reason I chose that I","think - - I don't","know . Okay . I","of circumstantial , because I","is controversial . And I","speech here . I don't","it's necessary and I don't","it's right . And I","that . I just don't","versus Democrats , I definitely","thoroughly investigated . I don't",". Right . I just","can't control , I just","is , but I don't","hell . \" I don't","be very productive in any","the least . I just","than others . And I",". And I don't really","on it . But I","really liked slavery , I","first of all , I","it's important to get to","because being educated and having","to have a more thorough","also , just in a","that word is all in","open discussion . That's how","ideas are created and how","have . Mm-hmm . I","I feel . But I",", like slavery , I","a positive manner . I","think you can create a","a discussion you can even","Mm-hmm . But then the","it can lead to other","I'm not sure . I","? So personally , I","speakers on campus . I",". And so I don't","really any clear way of",". And the right often","of - - you don't","finally , you can only","Mm-hmm . How would you","Yeah . No , I","- - Yeah , I","this is one of those","not quite sure what to","of put one of the",", I get what you","first of all , I","away from the whole slavery","affected by it . I","are moving away from the","Yeah . Yeah , I","and everything . I don't","think reparation is a bad","bad idea . I just","like - - I guess","problems too . So I","say . However , I","to come . So I","their right because can you","Steve Bannon . I just","even though - - you","another thing is that I","I think it's interesting to","liberal , I don't really","change your mind . I","that it would actually be","are really dangerous , I","disagree , but I just","come to campus , you",", I agree . I","if they're coming , I","to our campus . I","go . That's what I","I totally see why people","in this bubble where we","their views . So I","them to speak because I","feel we need to be","a diverse campus and being","if you're not going to","Yeah . So do you","changed or do you still","Definitely . Yeah . I","them look bad , you","but we were just really",", and it made us","what he says , that","if they - - you","not judge . But I","people to make the right","with your points . I","points . I think you","in action , whereas I","people . And I also",", but I never really","in action . So I","action it's a lot more","But there's also a moral","exactly . Mm-hmm . I","so much different when you","action versus just supporting the","supporting the idea . I","the same page on the","talking about drugs and the","isn't working . And I","in our society in the","police state . And I",". And , in this",", flipping the script and","totally hear you . I",". I think that makes","was just a higher up","by those in power who","So then I guess the","question is how do you","change , how do we","are going to make bad","around them . But I","have been a one-off bad","sudden there were future research","research findings [ that ]","it . Yeah , I",". Oh wait , I",". For me , I","slightly against , but I",". So then , I","group , then I don't","unless they have a very","have a very comprehensive ,","point [ where ] I","liberal that sometimes you just",". I was , I","see . Yeah , I","thing - - I don't","political . But then I","It's like , I don't","I don't know why they","this thing , when I","not ? \" I don't","Milo was giving out personal","or not . I just","people , then I don't",", \" Why do you",". And then when I","controversial speakers , I don't","mostly liberal , I don't","don't know . I don't","affiliation . But when I","of extremely controversial speakers I","people like Milo . I","with legalizing drugs . I","rehabilitation , but I don't","the way . Because I","and nicotine - - I","often make people make misinformed","the best state of making","around them . So I","And for rehabilitation , I","drugs , but I don't","for help . But I","necessarily wrong . But I","legalizing other drugs , I","with taking drugs . I","this will be a more","legalized . So I don't","leisure because personally I don't","leisure use . So I","a huge fan because I",", as well as to","not equipped - - I","is the purpose , I","the thing is , I","liberal , but I do","I'm Jewish - - I","should be killed . I","parents are immigrants , I","people - - And I","such a degree that just","and that they don't really","they don't really think things","the actual event . I","hear the speakers . I","been able to . You",". You know . You","actually am against this whole","this whole idea . I","this , I wanted to","controversial speakers are . I",". And that's where I","major conflicts . So I","that's about it . I","a free speech campus is",", I'll just read the",". That's true . I",". So last year ,",". Oh yeah . I","that ? Yeah . I","well , I don't really","like - - I don't","what they're called . I","out to those because I","the marching , I don't","Yeah . And then I","were - - I don't","- - I didn't really","good . I need to","to buy - - I","first of all because I","faced discrimination and I don't","example , someone whose family","- - or I don't","you would quantify systematically the","race you are . That","Mm-hmm . I guess another","- But then there's the","sort of , I don't","responsible for it ? I","Hi . So I can","I get that . I","these debates , I just","feel like I'm not super","not super informed enough to","strongly about it . You","But I just want to","to know , what's your","what's your logic ?

And I","with things like needle exchanges","people are afraid to use","just allowing those is a",". Yeah . Okay .",". I was just thinking",", I don't necessarily know","about how it works in","that like - - I",". I think just like","just like legalization of weed","you were saying that making","like that's not necessarily true","if you make it legal",". I think like ,","like , for example ,",". I think I'd have","I'd have to look at","it better , because this","about . But I think","maybe looking to that as","if I can take a","more information about Portugal and","about Portugal and how that","it's interesting though , because","if you can draw parallels","I'd have to look at","more about it , but",". Yeah , yeah .","exactly what I said on",", I know what I","what I believe , so",", so I'll just assume","that that's how I answered","on the survey . Basically","it's a great idea to","to legalize all drugs .","that certain drugs should be","to interrupt , but can","? So by the standard",", alcohol and cigarettes are","what your thoughts - -","- - do you think","alcohol should be legal ?","what you mean by degrees","by degrees of addiction .","alcohol would be just as","about Oregon or states where","should be more widespread legal","about dosages and how much","what they're talking about ,","is something you don't even","I don't think narcotics or","narcotics or really anything in","should be legalized . I","that is a huge epidemic","trends and kids hopping on","the cool new thing .",", I just have a","it's just kind of a","of where you draw the","- - I come from",", think that those are","that those are good or","- - this is tangentially","and this is something I","that legalizing drugs is a",", what are your thoughts","on how people who are","drug laws here - -","because so many substances are","I was in high school","if you - - things","because of that people are","the prompt said this ,","that with the opioid epidemic","it's just tough because if","what the jail time looks","putting someone into jail which","where I think at least","at least certain kind of","that's a very gray area","that you put that drugs","that ? Mm-hmm . Yeah","that drugs should be legalized","that's because I think that","that , if you do",", easier to do research","probably less people in jail","a lot of people go",". Yeah . Yeah ,","for me though , just","someone that died . Well","he was rolling or something","like if it was legalized","a lot of my friends","that's something you have to","so too . But it's",". So do you have","what I'm talking about ?","sessions and stuff , and","session . And I was","what to do . No","Haas is really hard to","that . I'm a sophomore","like pre-meds are snake-y honestly","like pre-meds fuck you over","I could do this for","what ? Data science just",", this is ideal because","it would be like ,","what you mean . Okay",". Okay , yeah .","med school too . When","that going to Berkeley would","it is . If you're",", when I did it","only 6 families , or","people better that way .","they're of a more addictive",". I feel like generally","like generally it should be","under certain circumstances , like","or other nonmedical reasons that","that are approved , you",". This is just what",". That makes sense .",". Yeah . I don't",". Oh well . Yeah","like drugs are so prevalent","everyone just talks about it","jobs . Yeah , I","like everything in Berkeley is","that after you get in","they started it Spring 2018",". It was too late","like it's not as useful","grad school and the fact","like . Recruiting-wise too ,",". When grad schools look","session . I might .",". You don't have to","part of a family ,","it would cause more addiction",", that in the long","that if you need drugs","like the argument can go","what the right thing to","like if they legalize drugs","if they decided to legalize","to legalize drugs past a","like we should - -","that legalizing may be able","addicted since it may be","like we should - -",". Yeah . Yeah .",". Right . Yeah and",", to your point ,","at the beginning of the","it was San Francisco -","seeing all those ads about","that what you're saying ,","about how that works in","that there are definitely ways",", maybe more background checks","like that's kind of hard","how a person - -","are . I'm not saying",", but yeah . Yeah","that after like talking about","I'm more on your side","a lot of times for","I have a point on","very impulsively . And after","about that . \" Yeah","that it might stay that","how a real solution would","would be reached , because","like there isn't a lot","? Mm-hmm . No ,","that that's a really interesting","about it because that's something","obviously not everyone but African","like they should also have","that . And I think","if you look through history","to put Japanese Americans in",". The only reason why","why I was thinking about","about it in not necessarily","it could take shape in","why I know so much","so much about this is","why I'm for it for","that it has on not","that historically , if you","- - I mean even","even here a little bit","how we'd go about fixing","it's a system issue ,","about supporting government reparations ?","just in the form of",", granting money . I","through government programs and stuff","? Yeah , I agree","that the government should -","that there should be welfare","it should be race specific","? It should just be",", but I kind of","the same way about affirmative","to target disadvantaged people .","why a racial target ,",", could be desirable because","the government should do something","? Yeah , that's exactly",". I was thinking maybe","maybe invest more in schools","of just giving checks out","? Yeah . Yeah ,",". We're agreeing on most",". I feel like most","like most of the Asians","the same way because we","to me . Yeah .","it's not really fair because","like college should be whoever's","of other people when they're","we're stopping . Okay ,","that there's a better way","that's not fair . And","of [ this ] more",". I'm thinking taxes and","taxes and not so much","definitely there is an issue","of government reparations . Especially","it's kind of an unfair","that , \" Okay ,","the Japanese internment was a","there's a more efficient way","I could agree with that","you're opposed to reparations ?","reparations would be equitable with",", and this is why",". I'm less opposed to","about it like this .","you should have to pay","unfair , right ? You","that the same thing should","if the debt should carry","if we should be the","? Right , right ,",". But yeah , actually","just giving people money -",". It's not sustainable ,","? Yeah . My main","how people would have to","that just might create more","it might just worsen that","? Yeah , same .","that any kind of welfare","because there are successful people","it's the whole , \"",". My ideas were ,","were , instead of giving",". That's funny because I","like we were supposed to","we're - - this isn't","? We're agreeing . Yeah",", Berkeley doesn't have affirmative",". The Ivy [ league","? They've worked so hard",", especially with jobs and","it's important to have a","? Yeah , that makes",". I think where I'm","where I'm coming from is","it's productive for society to","it's important . Especially with","problems that affect communities that","? Yeah , I get","how to - - Okay","your point . At first","prompt ] , I was","more about it , and","connecting someone to a descendant",". I just think they're","they're marginalizing a specific group","that slavery is a part","like , just the question","in general , it's focusing","? And if government reparations","and talked about . \"",". Yeah . I feel","like ultimately the reason why","why I'm mainly against the","of a reparation isn't because","like the bigger issue isn't",". That's what I learned","in most of my education","I'm going to raise the","how to do it .","that you are opposing government","as to why ? Yeah","that slavery can be accounted","the difference between slavery and","there should be some sort",", specifically for slavery ,",". Of starting from zero",". Yeah . Yeah ,","it has to do more","in pulling these people out","why I do support it","I'm not super for it","the freedom of speech is","it just allows space for","other ideas . Because there",". Because there are not","people who might be single-minded","of learning about different sides","about different sides have the",". I think it's a","it's a great place for","that you wouldn't find in","in smaller areas or less","that's just the risk they","my issue more was ,",". Yeah . So ,","just because it's a good","everything , but the boundaries","these are all pretty mellow","[ for ] the other","before it was just only",". I feel like this","like this has been 6","about legalizing drugs ? Yeah","that , I think ,",", a little more .","my general consensus on this","to not legalize it ,","that it can become really","really dangerous if you do","that it's the norm and","- - it's a health","it's okay , and you","from a really young age","I'd be really worried about","that our healthcare system is","it should be legalized ,","is similar to what you",". Yeah , absolutely .",". Yeah , and I","that we're just in the","that the data's going to","they'd probably have to follow",". And it's really hard","it's definitely going to be",". I think it's kind","it's kind of similar to","how bad it is .","that marijuana is nearly as","that there's a reason why","why they banned - -","to see what are the",". Because it is more","the health effects cannot be","cannot be that adverse ,","unless you ran a case","the terms a little bit","for me , what I","was hard drugs , not","that's a little bit different","to legalize things that have","the whole problem with the","that there should be -","that is not a good","that we should be focusing","that drugs themselves , hard","to legalize them . One",". Also , our government","aren't good for us to",", if those things are","the main thing is that",", for me personally ,","there's two options that they're","phrases it is like ,","to use fewer drugs and","are in recreational drugs like","is that in California ,","on the street . There's","to buy from an illegal","what's in it , and","it's not going to be","they're not going to get","employed in the United States","that this question is specifically","is specifically about legalization ,","heroin and meth are different","solution would give the job","would give the job of","to have chemical effects on","on the brain . I","that making it legal for",", if it's for medical",", there should be separate","it right , is that","I didn't really know that","that much about it .","the black market in general","if it was under the","about it , because we","in that way . Yeah","like they might as well",", if [ people ]",", they're usually too scared","when they're using it because",". No , that makes","because if they're going to","made me lean towards the","that there should be freedom",". And there are other","if they can explore these","these mediums that are probably","about this actually - -",", have you seen the","of that scene when I","out . Yeah , that's","of . And they end","how much time is left",". Yeah . You too","one concern is if we","how we're going to help","you might have a better","on this . Yeah .","I just don't know whether","whether slavery is a direct","your thoughts on that .","on that . Okay .","on that ? Oh ,",", I question about individual","about individual responsibility . And","that slavery - - well","my main concern is ,","why there are so many","why they're poor ? Maybe","why - - I mean","I just don't know whether","whether reparations actually help these","better or become wealthier in","wealthier in our society .","very strongly about that .","like I fall a little","I guess that's where I","when we filled it out","are adequate . Especially when","race , minority , poverty","how I feel about all","about all drugs necessarily ,","the whole healthcare thing which",". And I would be","like a lot of the","about this issue , the","of was kids . And","about kids doing drugs and","about - - for example","that , in my mind","how to explain it .","it . Yeah . Also","people that I know -","- - I don't want","a lot of people who","like - - not by","that it's a good thing","about it . Because ,","? Cool . Well nice","in general with reparations for","like nothing could actually fix","instead of reparations for slavery","from the other hand ,","- - Oh , continue","like , at the same","it's a huge portion to","it's the beginning . It","about the details , it",", yeah , so it","with , for example ,","somewhat moral when in reality","like - - so I","being where we are today","any bit of aid would","out aid or reparation .","time is up . Yeah","of diversity in political thought",". Because I also think","that being exposed to ideas","that you aren't normally exposed","that , in times with","that the incoherent , incendiary","controversial speakers - - because","Donald Trump . It can","Bernie Sanders , but ,",". It's their followers and","that if - - because","we should be very cautious","or understand what they're talking","what they're talking about can","experience . It's just that","we're in a very unique","of protests . We are","it's a mindset . I","freshmen that were very uncomfortable","that their first exposure to","to use them . And","about those drugs and rehabilitation","it is a perspective thing","thing because based on how","like they had nowhere to","like that's - - I","what to do . Then","towards the conversation on subjects","and then I can start","I oppose is , I","thing that I'm personally -","of a non-drug user ,","that legalizing drugs means that","that the government is putting","like legalizing all drugs will","what's going on if I'm","for that . But I","that's a reason why we","why we need to legalize","that free speech should prevail","I chose that I think","- - I don't know",". Okay . I think","that the controversial issue is","it depends on what they","if a person comes and","it's necessary and I don't","it's right . And I","that certain topics shouldn't be","those have any beneficial aspects","that those should be entertained","it's fair to just deem","that for things that people","it's completely unfair to -","having a really hardcore Catholic","that would be very productive",". I can't see how","it would be hateful speech","I would draw the line","the circumstances of what the","that if their premise was","we should reinstate it ,","that it's important to get","both sides of any issue","isn't just one way .","of both sides . And",", \" controversial , \"","because if you're on one","are created and how thought","movements occur . Without an",". But I feel like","like also that even if","that the discussion doesn't have","you can create a sense","of neutrality or if it's","the other person why maybe","arises But then also at",". Like just , yeah","everyone else is finishing up","that we should be allowed","that controversy allows us to","it's harmful in that way","when that will stop .","already alienated on a lot","when it's going to stop","common ground through talking and","if there was a space","that makes total - -","you had some good points","where I was kind of",". \" So I just",". Yeah , yeah ,",". Yeah . Okay .","that , in terms of","and how African Americans used","like Americans in general are",", and , just from",". Yeah . Yeah ,","reparation is a bad idea",". I just think it's","it's not like - -","goes into that too .","like it's - - Yeah","that it's really important that","it's kind of unfair to","if , let's say ,","it'd be unfair if you","? And then another thing","it's interesting to learn from","from opposing views . If","that listening to Steve Bannon","that it would actually be",". And yeah , while","that it would also be","that it's unfair to not","? What's your take ?","that people don't want them","it's almost weaker to not","that the mature approach is",", but I totally see","that it's wrong if they","that their views are dangerous","it's just unfair and it's","we need to be accepting","of everyone because that's what","and if you're not going","these views then that's kind","that your mind is changed","that they should not be","it was cool that we","? Totally . Did you",". We were like ,","so horrible to watch this","he's disgusting , [ and","? It's so hard to","the mature thing to do",". Yeah . And it's","you thought about more how","about more how it will","about the morals behind it","that slavery is sort of","it to be in action","your arguments are correct in","to pay reparations . But","that we should , we","it's so much different when","about it in action versus",". I think we're on","we're on the same page","of reparations but - -","is , \" Do you","the broader issue is the","that we have a very","there are alternatives to having",", you would be caring","how should we focus on","that makes sense that ,","that , if something is","that was made by those",", \" Oh , all","is how do you determine","which drug is a hard",", \" Maybe this might",", and they might hurt","[ of ] the fact",", but at least ,","[ that ] determined that","that maybe this might be","you have a really good","we're done . Well ,","I put I was slightly","mainly I was looking at","that the proponents of different","like they should be allowed",", logical speech . Yeah","speech . Yeah , yeah","like they were going a","they're liberal to the point","it was when Milo was","like it is a very","exactly how this works .","like if maybe there's a","why they think that .","that . Why are they","it's like , \" Why",". Because I said \"","about students that would be","reading that somewhere . So","that - - that's not","that way ? \" Yeah","of controversial speakers , I","if it's because I'm a",". I don't know what","what political affiliation . But","of extremely controversial speakers I","of people like Milo .","of the more conservative people","your viewpoint that we need","legalizing drugs is the way","if we legalize other drugs","it will encourage more people",". So , after taking","and doing things that you","it will encourage people to","different approaches can be made","legalizing drugs is the way","it should be more of","legalizing it won't make it","minimizing the penalty for drug-taking","this will be a more","way to deter people from","there's an extreme need to","that actually weed should be","we should separate the uses","that campuses are supposed to","you and educate you ,","if you're a person saying",", of a liberal arts","like , even that ,","that you - - also","that Nazis should be able","that just as long -","that should be allowed even","that's exactly the point ,","all the stereotypes of ,","things logically , and that",", and that they're actually","also I went to the","that's the point where it's",". You know how L.A","how L.A . is .",". I think that's what","that's what you were trying","what extremely controversial speakers are","- - oh , wait","things go out of hand","that's not actually what a","they should be allowed ,","for . No , I",", I guess Yeah .","like I've never been that",", I didn't really care","it was . Was he",", well , I don't","why we invite speakers in",", oh I forgot what","they're the protests or whatever","we've had a few of",". I've never done any","it was last year where",", my dad saw it","about it because I wasn't","out how to buy -","ride the bus . Oh","slavery is kind of too","how these reparations would take","as Black American but doesn't","how you would quantify systematically","that race has on a","kind of divisive and backward","I have is , this","As the government before ?",", it kind of comes","part of the argument was","that since we're partners that","a lot of times ,","like I'm not super informed","enough to feel strongly about","strongly about it . You","? Yeah . But I",", what's your logic ?","? Your thinking ? Yeah","? Yeah , I get","between African Americans - -","of structural racism . I","about this in one of","there's a lot of controversy","like it's justified in doing","in doing so . Obviously","how a lot of African","where I'm going with this","that the government needs to",". Exactly , yeah .","thing ? But that's the","than the average non-White minority","? Oh , but anyways","it's a good idea in","in this situation . But","this question based on just","based on just me personally","was just because I know","what my values are and","what I believe in .","in . And even if","they're going to make me","like they were almost doing","I would either . Oh","one of my friends was","so . Bye .","people going there from countries","to be - - at","you've got drug bosses ,","because they're not a legal","if it was something legal","the argument for me would","? Right . No ,","of that . I was","even - - and I","it was brought up in","too , that , for",", is that oftentimes drugs",", not in 100 percent","that drugs tend to -","to be as big of","by - - I'm not","about that ? Oh .","if I would say that","more of like - -",", if it doesn't fall","another thing that makes it","they mentioned in the survey","if that's right . I","a lot of people probably","we hit everything that was","it was just made up","about it - - Yeah",", but I really just","more about the logistics of","it really depends on who","that's perfectly fine . Yeah","if it's just like the","so . I think it's","it's just a different view","about it . I mean",", if they're particularly saying","like that's going too far","like that's just another opinion",". Yeah , true .",". Uh-huh . Yeah .",". So I feel like","like they definitely need to","like I should introduce myself","as to what you're saying","there should be a clarification","when they say extremely controversial",". Because I think that","that there are some figures","that are controversial , but","that you still should be","what I mean ? Mm-hmm","? Mm-hmm . For sure","on behalf of the university","that they're going to get","that there are going to","? I think that at","that at the end of","into the thing where [","to 2017 . I think","that even though they did","it was cool to see","it's also cool to see",". And go against -","if people don't feel safe","safe with the ideas that","that these people are putting","? It's good to have",". Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .","as good . I don't",". I always envision ,","comfortable with that idea because","because he's very extreme .","for me , honestly ,","out what - - I","we probably both agree that","of government reparations , of","and training for police brutality",", yeah , that my","what these programs would entail","heavily . But I could","whether an African American is","everyone is , because that's","already redolent with many issues","the history , but it","the long history of slavery","getting caught in the slave","or what their personal family","to their actions . But","there could be funding cut","where the funding would come","? Yeah . Yeah .",", I think I would","I would love to talk","what they really mean by","by government reparations . I","more what this program would","it was made up for","about . It just seems","kind of like - -","the general sentiment that I","was \" yes . \"","if it's a real program","it's like - - Yeah","that they should be legalized",". What do you mean","by meth was legal for","it's not anymore ? Right","that contributes anything in terms","illegal in the first place",", just because it feels","wrong to me . Like","it just didn't work -","there is a solution or","or even a perfect solution","to this , at all","just to clarify , maybe",", maybe I just misread",", but the reason for","for my stance was more","that it is opening a","that there have been case","if that would be the","that's a pretty good response","exactly if opioids classify in","as we were discussing ,","more about the opioid crisis","addicted . And I think","we can both agree that","about the issue in that","as of now , I","that's a very strong argument","that , as a general","of the campus . But",", especially at Berkeley ,","? So I think a","a lot of people would","speakers like that should be","people that want to listen","it reflects negatively on the","negatively on the campus ,","that other people are backing","of some speakers and their","if you think it'd be","it'd be okay . So","most people at Berkeley are","that should be allowed ?",", probably not hate speech","that would constitute harmful speech","the same thing . I","I wouldn't go listen to","that a lot of people","you have to respect other",". What about if you","of anything else . Oh","that's a much bigger issue","of separating kids from their","not many people do .",", are kind of just","that speaker should be allowed",". I don't think it","it really is harmful just","? Yeah , but how","? I think it depends","it depends on the speaker",", for the university to",", \" Oh , they","that they should be legalized","that they do use .","is the number of people",". And a lot of","to at least decriminalize them","? Okay . Well ,","that the smaller a program","would not be a nationwide","you do have a really","to see as to where","to at least improve and","part of it is ,",", \" Hey , you",", maybe that's not necessary","part of that was financial","that this regulation of drugs","that that goal has been","that that's why it continues","? Okay . My name","the question to first understand","to first understand what it","what it means . So",". So we're living on","is , \" Do you","that not everyone might be","I support that everyone's consent","I wasn't supporting this idea","is that [ the prompt",". But when the topics","that might be too much",". The fact that you","doesn't mean that the idea","that the idea doesn't exist","doesn't exist . So ,",", I think it should","it should be heard by",", that might be harmful","it really depends on the","the point of expressing yourself",", not to force people","in what you're saying .",", but I think about","about some kind of enforcement","people to believe in what","in what you believe in","in . And I think","especially because we're on campus",", but I would not","me or trying to force","in an idea . Yeah",". Yeah . Yeah .","it's the same anywhere on",", I like the food","repetitive . Oh . I","we need to stop .","to support that criminalization of","safer . So for example","that these needles are for","them because drugs are already","them .

The","that people have negative side","with drugs , is either","how to use that drug","how to use these drugs","what they were getting into","of PTSD . And so",", and when we illegalize","from being able to take","that's reasonable . I think",". I think one of","one of my questions .",". It was nice talking","when I hear that it's","so . Bye .","is that I don't think","it would help . I","a lot of people don't","of it , so I","there would be a lot","? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .","is , where is the","that creating major resentment and","the government reparations meant .",". Yeah . I guess","each other ? Keeping with","you too . Cool .","like it's a no-brainer obviously","for the most part that","that much about American history","with what exactly ? Yeah","for the most part ,",". I personally don't think","that's valid because buying someone","any of the issues I've","reparations should be done .","like the government should decide","how they want to go","buying a house is sufficient",". Yeah . Yeah ,","we weren't supposed to start","the scenario poses , that","like that's kind of a","we could invest in certain",". What people groups are",", about that .

Yeah , sounds good","about the whole safety aspect","it's not a first amendment",". What did I write","I just feel Berkeley especially","Berkeley especially is a very","getting different viewpoints some of","you're right that it's definitely","means of communicating those and","of communicating those and especially","what they talked about ,","?

So",", I feel it's hard","it's hard to balance those",", I don't know -","- - I haven't researched","? But yeah , I","? Yeah . Yeah .",". \" Right . Yeah","it really worked for them","here .

It's hard to support","it's the lesser of two",". I tend to support","like it'll make it -",", because I know people","people - - it's a","? And it's hard to","of as a medical problem","of it as a personality","? But yeah , it's",". It's hard to give","to say that it works","like I've read somewhere that","we're done . Yeah ,","what it was talking about","the reference that they give","that they give is talking","having him on our campus","to believe that he was","that he was going to","it's okay for people like","about that ? Same .","- - another question -","- - sorry , I",", I'm just trying to",". So when it comes","by controversial issues ? What","is appropriate to be on","like with the recent people","is fair because a lot","it also goes to dismiss",". But why do we","why it's necessary to have","it's - - even if","safe . I personally -","safe when I see police",". I'm being dismissed for","are and it's like ,",". Yeah , for sure","that everyone in a democracy","that they should have had","there might be somebody in",", and banning someone from","is basically discriminating against them",". I agree with the",". It's basically abetting to","that Berkeley as a university","for the students here .","what thing is right ,","for the students here ,",". Yeah . That's true","for them . But yeah","we've gone through that now","there could be some better","there'd be a better way",". Yeah . All right","a party , I'd be",". Yeah . And as","nothing . Yeah . So","about the other topic [","it's similar to alcohol .","too much money is wasted","you need to ban everything","? Uh-huh . Yeah .","so , I guess .","I oppose them , but","was personal experiences . So","the survey we filled out","what governments can do quite","the control , it's more","moving to a place where","so . Yeah , that's","it's just contrasting goals .","- - wait , so","anything about if that's helped",", I guess , reading","based - - you can't","like yes or no .","that's a fair point .","I can probably link that","that back to my friend","- - yeah , so","to this . Yeah .","what's tough also is that",". Yeah , completely agree","as you were saying that","you brought up a point",", whatnot . Yeah ,","crack cocaine and meth should","there are a lot of","making weed legal was a","certain drugs like heroin and","we'd have more problems if",", I don't really know","where to get opium ,","should be done ? Yeah",". I think maybe people","maybe people who make the","just throwing a bunch of","that drugs should be legal",". They could work from","the problem . Because if",". I just don't think","it's a good call .","there'd be a lot of","? Yeah , yeah .","like there should be some",", but don't you think","more people would be willing","a lot of people are","people are doing it for",". And I think more","more people would do it","and get addicted if it",", something . Yeah .","I admire their audacity and","like this conversation is going","we're going to - Yeah",". I mean I'm excited","I'm excited to see him",". We'll see . All","that there really is a","in terms of that ,","that the controversial speakers are",", to some extent ,","what the students are able","would be to have some","if Berkeley were to cancel","how it's aligned with democratic","majority rules in a democracy","maybe socially liberal , but","it's very inefficient too .","we have to see it",". I mean it is","it is a bodily addiction","we're on the same page","school from where you are","academically it's really rigorous ,",". Okay . So do","for me , after hearing","that possibly decriminalizing the drug","if you know that much","that much about prostitution ,","by maybe bringing the government","that was a reason why","why maybe legalizing it is","how they expect that to","that there's potential to help","it might also help recovering","people who do a ton","that you've been selling drugs",", I'm trying - -","as if it's become better","better just because it's more","the people that I know","used to illegally buy it","the government has this information",", but it doesn't seem","like - - you're not","? So there is a","your marijuana is not laced",", this might be a","by legalizing it you have","about . Yeah , yeah","doing another , maybe ,","and - - I honestly","it said that - -","what it said [ in",". It said legalizing drugs","that there's been less convictions",", there was something positive","maybe I could agree on","that people who want to","it , you're going to","comfortable and feel safe to","safe to be like ,","when you make something illegal","this too . So I","to responsibly drink and she",", a new element because",". I think - -","- - yeah , I","you can support legalizing all","in decriminalizing it , so",". So I mean it","it depends , because I","if we just all agree","brought up and maybe is","out is good for us","? Yeah . But there's",". But see , we",", I think you're still","you're still going to lose","people smuggling alcohol during the","to legalize it . So","there are pros that come","what's actually in the stuff","junior year is when you're","about all your college memories","and how you kind of",", yeah . Oh ,","we did reach some common","we're ending this . It","- - I don't know",", I guess . I","making them illegal is an","way to stop the use","there's a better way .","that it should be promoted","that making them illegal is","way to go about it",". But I think that","that drugs - - making","like if you wanted a","it . But if you","where to get opium ,","you could do that .","instead of using prison as","it's useful to just use","all the drug dealers in",". If you're 12 and","there's ways you could -","to get a drug ,","making it legal would be","if you wanted to before","if it's legal then companies","how you regulate food ?","- - I don't know",", if - there are","that that's not safe ,","like affects them in any","if you read it in","what country it was ,","makes sense because I think","because I think there's sort","there's sort of this -","that's the thing with a","so refreshed today . Yeah",". Wow . That's a","? We'll see . We'll","on the issue ? I",", I think free speech","free speech is important and","it's important to allow speakers","is , if you don't","if it's hate speech and","an issue . But if","it's important to hear both","like people are so close-minded","very problematic in and of","as someone , they don't",". But I could see","- - personally , I","he's very immature and doesn't","like he shouldn't even want",", if it's - -","it really depends on the","it's unfair to not let","controversial people can bring discourse","that what they're saying is",", I think it really","it really depends . But","- - it just seemed","totally unnecessary . Last year","it's the response of people","that there's the police presence","like that would just solve","everything . Yeah , yeah","anything isn't - - I",". If someone wants to","like there are always people","violent , that's when action",". And I think that's","that's very valid . But","on how the Free Speech","like . And so I","in and stand up for","that's important and that shows","the best thing in that","that would be the best","that's a good reason in","in general to protect free","it's a little different when","a university definitely has an","thinking and open-mindedness , and","and open-mindedness , and these","than in building up their","some speakers if they were","didn't match yours ?

That's kind of all",", not because they were",", but if we're coming","that , but I think","what I mean is -","is - - I think","the bigger point when I","- - definitely slavery is","the racism that's prevalent today","it's prevalent towards other groups","like it's prevalent towards almost","if we are giving reparations","it'll be - - it'll","- - I think other","other minorities will revolt .","it will be unfair to","it's unfair if we just",".

And at that time","and not because they were","that means that the government","that the government should not","- - I think it's","it's done . I don't",".","you don't . Okay .","[ in ] the first","that the reason why is","why is that it's because",", mixing glass into cocaine","is , when you legalize","that is to do with",". You're just punishing people","other methods such as rehabilitation","the consequences of different drugs","in terms of that ,","? Okay . I think","the thing is , with","it's not really completely legalizing","should be put in place","it's more to do with","that it might be exposing","when you have the opportunity","super strongly on this topic","like I don't really have","on this topic and all","?

I",".

That's true , that's","that it kind of feels","like a blend of these","answering this question difficult .","this question difficult . I","difficult . I don't know",". I don't necessarily think","that legalizing these drugs is",", but I do think","that better rehabilitation programs would",". So it's like I'm","if there's a way that","even marijuana , that kind",", I have a really","a future where the mass","like that applies to a","that a lot of places","that will translate and have",".

I think that a","that a lot of the","like , yeah , maybe","of rehabilitation but also keeping","- - I had five","why it wouldn't be a",". First of all ,",", because taking all these","of what you are doing",", like with cognition ,","was drugs are related to","to other crimes that are","to the health effects ,",", it would lead to","with machines and cars obviously","was kids getting involved with","legal .
